# Dagger extension for Boring YURI

A [KSP][3] extension for `Boring Yuri` to provide generated `Uri` factories as injectable
[Dagger][1] dependencies.

To be able to inject the generated `Uri` factories you need to add a generated module in the
application [Component][2] like in the example:

```kotlin
@Singleton
@Component(
        modules = [
           ...
        BoringYuriModule::class
        ]
)
interface AppComponent : AndroidInjector<App> {
    @Component.Factory
    interface Factory : AndroidInjector.Factory<App>
}
```

When you have the generated `dagger` module included in your application component, you may enjoy
your injectable `Uri` factories:

```kotlin
class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity {

    @Inject
    lateinit var uriFactory: ContactUriFactory

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        AndroidInjection.inject(this)

        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        ...

        val contactUri = uriFactory.buildContactUri(42)
        ...
    }
}
```

## Sample

The detailed example on how to use `dagger` extension for `Boring Yuri` can be found in
[sample-dagger](../dagger-sample).

## Installation

To add `dagger` extension for `Boring Yuri`, include the following in your app module
`build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
dependencies {
        ...
  ksp("com.github.anton-novikau:boringyuri-dagger-ksp:2.0.0")
}
```

## Configuration
Dagger extension annotation processor for `Boring Yuri` supports the following configuration
option:

 * `boringyuri.dagger.module` â€“ if the option is not set, the default name of the `dagger`
   generated module is `boringyuri.dagger.BoringYuriModule`. But if you prefer to have the module
   in your own package or would like to give it a different name, you may use this option and
   provide a new fully qualified name that works for you better.

To enable the option above you need to include the following in your app module
`build.gradle.kts` (or `build.gradle`) file:

```kotlin
ksp {
  arg("boringyuri.dagger.module", "your.company.domain.BoringYuriModule")
}
```
